# ROB501: Computer Vision for Robotics

## Assignment 1: Image Transformations & Billboard Hacking

### Fall 2024

---

### Overview

In this assignment, you will explore essential concepts in computer vision, including perspective transformations, bilinear interpolation, and histogram equalization. Using these techniques, you will replace a portion of an image with another image to simulate a "billboard hack," ensuring that the insertion appears natural and adheres to the appropriate geometric and photometric properties.

### Submission Details
- **Due Date**: Friday, October 4, 2024, by 11:59 p.m. EDT
- **Submission Platform**: Autolab
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.10
- You may submit multiple attempts before the deadline.

Ensure your code is properly commented and adheres to the provided template. Submissions will be tested for correctness and clarity.

### Project Tasks

1. **Perspective Transformations**: Compute the perspective homography using the DLT algorithm to map points between images.
2. **Bilinear Interpolation**: Implement interpolation for subpixel accuracy during image warping.
3. **Histogram Equalization**: Enhance the contrast of grayscale images.
4. **Billboard Hacking**: Combine all components to create a realistic composite image replacing the billboard.
